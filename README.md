# Bank-Telemarketing-Success-Predictor
Objective: 
Developed a machine learning model to predict the success of bank telemarketing campaigns, focusing on classifying whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on historical customer interaction data.

About the data:
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Outcome:
Achieved an F1 score of ~0.73 for Random Forest, ~0.72 for LightGBM, and ~0.76 for XGBoost on the validation set, ensuring robust and reliable performance across models.
Improved the understanding of the influence of customer features on the success of telemarketing campaigns, which can be used for targeted marketing strategies.
